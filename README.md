## Introduction

This workshop will walk you through the process of deploying **Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)** on **Microsoft Azure**. We will stand up **Concourse** using **Pivotal Control Plane** and deploy PCF using **Platform Automation**. For complete documentation check out [Pivotal Control Plane](https://control-plane-docs.cfapps.io/)

## Install Pivotal Control Plane

### **STEP 1**: Clone Terraform template repository

- Open a terminal window and change to working directory. For documentation, working directory location will be `/Users/dfoley/development/Azure`.

```bash
cd /Users/dfoley/development/Azure
```

- Clone workshop repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfoleypivotal/azure-platform-automation-example.git
```

- Clone terraforming-azure repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfoleypivotal/terraforming-azure.git
cd terraforming-azure/terraforming-control-plane/
```

### **STEP 2**: Create an Automation Account

- First, find your account by running the following commands using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

```bash
az login
az account list
```

![](images/image2.png)

**Note:** Copy **Id** an **Tenant Id** as these values will be used later in the lab.

- Create Service Account for Bosh. For more details please view [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest)

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ServicePrincipalforBosh
```

![](images/image2.5.png)


- If you want to verify that the service principal was create you can login to the Azure Console. Click **Azure Active Directory** then **App registrations** and you will see the new **ServicePrincipalforBosh** application was created.

    ![](images/image5.png)

### **STEP 3**: Pave IaaS using Terraform

- Using the output from the previous step create and populate the **terraform.tfvars** file with the content below.

```bash
subscription_id = "Your Subscription Id"
tenant_id       = "Your Tenant ID"
client_id       = "appId from previous call"
client_secret   = "password from previous call"

env_name              = "controlplane"
ops_manager_image_uri = "https://opsmanagerwestus.blob.core.windows.net/images/ops-manager-2.4-build.192.vhd"
location              = "WestUS2"
dns_suffix            = "domain.com"

dns_subdomain         = "pcfcontrolplane"
```

- Create Infrastructure 

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

![](images/image7.png)

- Back on the Azure Console, you will see that a resource group named **controlplane** has been created and you can view all the resources that where created.

    ![](images/image8.png)

- Create an NS record on the parent DNS Zone with the records returned by the following. You can test 

```bash
terraform output env_dns_zone_name_servers
```

![](images/image9.png)

- Verify connectivity with the following command:

```bash
dig pcfcontrolplane.<your domain> NS +short
```

![](images/image10.png)

### **STEP 4**: Configure BOSH Director

- From any browser, access Ops Manger using URL defined by:

```bash
echo https://"$(terraform output ops_manager_dns)"
```

![](images/image11.png)

- Follow the Pivotal documentation [Configuring BOSH Director on Azure](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/om/azure/config-manual.html)

**Note:** On the *Create Networks Page* only create one network, following the *infrastructure* network guide, and set the *Name* field to *control-plane-subnet*

- For automated configuration run script **deploy-om-director.sh**

```bash
../../azure-platform-automation-example/scripts/deploy-om-director.sh
```

![](images/image11.5.png)

### **STEP 5**: Deploy Control Plane via Manifest

- Retrieve the assets from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/). Download the manifest and all of the releases from [Pivotal Control Plane Components](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-control-plane-components/#/releases/359492)

**Note:** Currently you need to select **Release 0.0.31**

![](images/image12.png)

- Download the stemcell for the releases from [Stemcells for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial#/releases/354816)

    ![](images/image13.png)


- Move downloaded files to current directory (it will make it easier to upload the assets later)

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/{control-plane*.yml,uaa-release*.tgz,credhub-release*.tgz,postgres-release*.tgz,garden-runc*.tgz,concourse-release*.tgz,*bosh-stemcell*.tgz} .
```

![](images/image14.png)

- You need to upload each asset to your Ops Manager VM in order to upload them to BOSH. Save the Ops Manager SSH KEY to an environment variable (the ***OPS_MANAGER_KEY_PATH*** variable can be arbitrary)

```bash
export OPS_MANAGER_KEY_PATH=./ops_manager_ssh_private_key

terraform output ops_manager_ssh_private_key > $OPS_MANAGER_KEY_PATH
chmod 0600 $OPS_MANAGER_KEY_PATH
```

![](images/image15.png)

- Save the Ops Manager environment variables for connecting with the om CLI

```bash
export OM_TARGET="https://$(terraform output ops_manager_dns)"
export OM_USERNAME="admin"
export OM_PASSWORD="$(terraform output ops_manager_password)"
```

![](images/image16.png)

- Set environment variables for connecting to BOSH

```bash
eval "$(om --skip-ssl-validation bosh-env --ssh-private-key $OPS_MANAGER_KEY_PATH)"
```

- Upload the assets to BOSH

```bash
bosh upload-stemcell *bosh-stemcell*.tgz
bosh upload-release concourse-release-*.tgz
bosh upload-release credhub-release-*.tgz
bosh upload-release garden-runc-release-*.tgz
bosh upload-release postgres-release-*.tgz
bosh upload-release uaa-release-*.tgz
```

![](images/image17.png)

- Retrieve the Control Plane domain and availability zones from Terraform.

```bash
export CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT_DOMAIN="$(terraform output control_plane_domain)"
```

- Make a **bosh-vars.yml** to hold these deployment vars:

```vi
---
external_url: https://plane.pcfcontrolplane.<your domain>
persistent_disk_type: 1048576
vm_type: Standard_F4s
azs: ["null"]
network_name: control-plane
wildcard_domain: "plane.pcfcontrolplane.<your domain>"
uaa_url: https://uaa.pcfcontrolplane.<your domain>
uaa_ca_cert: |
  $(credhub get -n /p-bosh/control-plane/control-plane-tls -k certificate | awk ‘{printf “%s\r\n  “, $0}’)
 ```

- Create  an operations file **azure-vm-extension.yml** with a single operation that replaces value of **vm_extension**.

```vi
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=web/vm_extensions?
  value: [control-plane-lb]
  ```
 

- Deploy the manifest from the Ops Manager VM

```bash
bosh deploy -d control-plane control-plane-*.yml \
  --vars-file=./bosh-vars.yml \
  --ops-file=./azure-vm-extension.yml
```

![](images/image18.png)


- Run the following command to verify that the deployment instances are running:

```bash
bosh instances -d control-plane
```

## Login to Control Plane

### **STEP 6**: Login to Control Plane UI

- You should also be logged into credhub if you have used the **om bosh-env eval** line from above. This allows you to easily get the credential we need to test the login of our control-plane.

```bash
credhub get -n $(credhub find | grep uaa_users_admin | awk '{print $3}')
```

![](images/image20.png)

- From any browser, access Concourse UI using URL defined by:

```bash
echo https://"$(terraform output control_plane_domain)"
```

![](images/image21.png)

![](images/image22.png)

- CLick **login** in the upper right hand corner.

- Enter **admin** for the `username`, and the password retrieved from Credhub as the `password` and click **SIGN IN**.

  ![](images/image23.png)

- Click **Authorize** 

**Note:** If the redirect fails, refresh the browser and click login again

  ![](images/image24.png)

### **STEP 7**: Login using FLY CLI

- If you don't already have the **fly cli** install you can download from the concourse page. Just click on the icon for you operating system.

  ![](images/image24.5.png)

- After the **fly cli** is downloaded make it executable and copy to a location in your path.

  ![](images/image24.7.png)

- login to Concourse using the main team. 

**Note:** You will be ask to authenticate via the browser. Copy the URL into your browser. Since we already authenticated in previous step you should not be ask to login.

```bash
fly login --target main -k -c https://$(terraform output control_plane_domain)
```

![](images/image25.png)


- After authenticating into Concourse, Create a team name **dev** for development pipelines..

```bash
fly set-team -t main -n dev --allow-all-users
```

![](images/image26.png)

- Login to the new team:

```bash
fly login --target dev -k -c https://$(terraform output control_plane_domain)
```
